Book Catalog: Users can browse through a catalog of books available in the application. The catalog includes various genres and categories, allowing users to discover books of interest.

Advanced Search: Booklib offers an advanced search functionality, enabling users to search for books by specific criteria such as author, title, or genre. This feature enhances the user experience by providing accurate search results tailored to their preferences.

Filtering and Sorting: Users have the ability to filter books by specific categories or genres. This functionality allows users to narrow down their search and find books that align with their preferences. Additionally, the application provides sorting options to organize search results based on relevance, popularity, or other criteria.

Book Details: Booklib provides detailed information about each book, including its title, author, description, publication date, and other relevant details. This allows users to gain a comprehensive understanding of a book before making a decision to read or purchase it.

User Interactions: The application incorporates user interactions such as saving books to a personal reading list or marking books as favorites. These features enable users to personalize their book recommendations and keep track of books they are interested in.


State Management with Hooks: I utilized React Hooks to manage the application's state effectively. This allowed for seamless updates and rendered a smooth user experience.

Filtering and Searching: The React Shop provides users with the ability to filter products by category and search for specific items using keywords. This feature enhances the user's browsing experience by providing tailored product suggestions.

Detailed Product Information: Users can view detailed information about each product, including relevant details such as photos, descriptions, prices, and availability. This helps users make informed decisions when selecting items to purchase.

Shopping Cart Functionality: The application enables users to add products to their shopping cart and modify its contents. This feature allows users to review their selections, update quantities, and proceed to the checkout process.

User Authentication and Login: To enhance security and personalize the experience, I implemented a user authentication system. This feature enables users to create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized features such as order history and saved payment methods.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
